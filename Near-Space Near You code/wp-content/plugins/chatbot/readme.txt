= ChatBot Support, Bug Fix, Feature Request =

* We welcome your feedback and new feature requests for this chat bot! W want to improve this chatbot's features based on your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if you face any problem or need help with this chatbot from the comments section.


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip file. Extract and upload in your wp-content/plugins folder.
2. From the wp-admin panel go to plugins and activate "Chatbot"
4. You are done.


== Use ==

1. Simply Activating the Plugin will start showing the ChatBot in the front end
2. Go to WPBot menu to adjust settings
3. Change All languages from the Language center area

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is my language supported? =
The ChatBot can work with ANY language. Just change the language texts from the ChatBot Settings->Language Center to your preferred one. Multi language is supported with the WpBot Pro version and an addon.

= I am not getting emails from the ChatBot =
The WPBot ChatBot uses the WordPress' default email function. If you are not getting emails from the ChatBot's email feature, it is likely that no emails are getting through from your WordPress site or they are ending up in the Spam box. Try using an SMTP mailer plugin. Also, try changing the to and from email addresses in the ChatBot's general settings area.

= I cannot connect the ChatBot to DialogFlow =
To Debug: 1. Make sure that you have created the Google Project and the Service account as an Owner
2. Make sure that you have connected to the correct Dialogflow agen
3. Follow the steps in this tutorial correctly: https://dev.quantumcloud.com/wpbot-pro/dialogflow-integration/
4. Make sure that the Google Client Package is Installed on Your Website.
5. Make sure to download and import the sample DialogFlow agent to your agent
6. Test the ChatBot in the browser Incognito mode

= Simple text responses are not working or getting an error =
WPBot requires mysql version 5.6+ for the simple text responses to work. If your server has a version below that, you might see some PHP error or the Simple Text Responses will not work at all. Please request your hosting support to update the mysql version on your server.

= I changed language or some other settings but do not see them when testing =
Please clear the browser cache and <strong>cookies</strong> to see any change you have made. Alternatively, you can open a fresh browser window in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N in chrome) to test your changes. Also, you may need to purge any cache plugin and CDN caching.

= The ChatBot is NOT working in the front end. =
The most common reason for this is if the theme is coded incorrectly and jQuery is loaded from external source. jQuery is included with WordPress core and according to WordPress standard, jQuery must be included using wp_enqueue_script. https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/ . Please make sure if that is the case in your theme. 

Please contact us if you need [further help](https://www.quantumcloud.com/resources/free-support/). We take all user feedback sriously.

= The ChatBot is stuck on typing or loading =
This usually happens if you enabled DialogFlow but did not complete the set up. Please make sure that you have carefully followed all the steps for DialogFlow integration in the Settings->DialogFlow section.
[This article](https://dev.quantumcloud.com/wpbot-pro/dialogflow-integration/) can also be helpful in getting the required information from DialogFlow console.

This can also happen if there is any empty language fields or Simple Text Responses database needs updating because of mysql version changes. Try saving both the Language Center and Simple Text Responses.


= How do I add new conversations to the ChatBot? =
Without DialogFlow: You can create simple text conversations with the <strong>[Conversational Form Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/conversational-forms/)</strong> addon by using the HTML elements to dislay your responses. The adoon does not yet support Conditional responses. We plan to add that feature soon. But for now, you can create linear conversations and display them from the Start menu. Once you have created a form using the Conversational form builder addon you can add it to the ChatBot start menu from the WPBot Settings->Start Menu. Make sure to always Save the ChatBot Start menu settings after rearranging the columns.

With DialogFlow: You can create new Intents and Text responses inside DialogFlow. For each user input, WPBot will automatically connect to DialogFlow and try to match with the Itents and training Data you added. When an Intent is matched, its response will be returned to the user.

= Does the ChatBot work with Google's DialogFlow V2 =
Yes, currently the ChatBot works both with Dialogflow version 1 and 2. V1 support will stop on Oct 23rd, 2019. 

[This article](https://dev.quantumcloud.com/wpbot-pro/dialogflow-integration/) can also be helpful in getting the required information from DialogFlow console.

= How do I add Line Breaks? =
Please use the br html tag for line breaks.

= Are HTML tags supported? =
Yes, common HTML tags link link href, strong, br etc. are supported.

= Does the ChatBot support images, GIFs, Videos =
Images, GIFs and Youtube Videos are supprted in the pro version. Pro version also includes a handy giphy floating search for easy embed in the language center.
